# Day 2 of 100 Days of Python
Today I worked on creating a several projects which are listed below.

### A Screenshot App

- A simple screenshot taking app which takes the screenshot of the present screen and saves it in the file name as `test.png` .

### Updated Screenshot App

- In the previous project, the screenshot got saved with the same name i.e. test.png so it replaced the previous screenshot with the new one.

- To avoid this we'll now create variables which will save the screenshot with random numbers like `1596658542193.png`.

### Screenshot GUI App

- In this project, I've made the Screenshot GUI App.

- It will help to take screenshot more easily.
