# Day 2 of 100 Days of Python
Today I worked on creating a several projects which are listed below.

### Project 1: A Screenshot App
[Browse](https://github.com/saswatsamal/100DaysofPython/blob/master/Day%202/Project/Project%201-%20Screenshot%20App/ScreenshotApp.py)
- A simple screenshot taking app which takes the screenshot of the present screen and saves it in the file name as `test.png` .

### Project 2: Updated Screenshot App

- In the previous project, the screenshot got saved with the same name i.e. test.png so it replaced the previous screenshot with the new one.

- To avoid this we'll now create variables which will save the screenshot with random numbers like `1596658542193.png`.

### Screenshot GUI App
[Browse](https://github.com/saswatsamal/100DaysofPython/blob/master/Day%202/Project/Project%203%20-%20Screenshot%20GUI%20App/ScreenshotGUI.py)
- In this project, I've made the Screenshot GUI App.

- It will help to take screenshot more easily.
