 # Day 04 of 100 Days of Python       
        
        So, today again I continued my 100 Days of Python after a break due to some problem.

- Today I've completed the **Crash Course on Python** by Google which is under the Automate Anything using Python Specialization,
- Under this course, today I've completed the first project i.e. **WORD CLOUD** of this specialization.
